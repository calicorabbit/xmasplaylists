# Holiday songs, sacred and profane: Gabriel's Message

Here we are again, family and friends, with another December and another holiday season. Christmas in Lansing starts on the Friday before Thanksgiving with Silver Bells in the City, this year the 40th incarnation of parade, lighting of the state Christmas tree accompanied by fireworks (and lately a light drone show). It's usually quite a cold affair, though this November has been rather warmish, much above normal temps, until Thanksgiving evening, when winter returned and we've been mostly below freezing with about two inches of snow.

As with  previous years, I'll shoot out a number of tunes from my holiday/Christmas collection of CDs, vinyl records, and cassettes. Most you can find streaming, some you will not. I'll include a lossless FLAC file that I hope most of you can listen to, and a link to YouTube Music (when  possible) for those of you who cannot play FLAC files (though, if you have any desktop, laptop, chromebook, tablet, smartphone that is newer than 12 years old--the current age of my desktop computer!--you should be able to play FLAC files!!!).

If you know any mutual friends or family who would like these holiday tunes and musings, let me know with a working email for them, and I'll add them to my distribution list.

So our first track is by the Irish singer Moya Brennan from her album _An Irish Christmas_ which was released in 2005. "Gabriel's Message" is a Baque Christmas carol often sung during the First Advent Sunday of Christmas, which happens to be today.

Basque, because Christene and I visited Jonathan, Emme and Shelby this summer when they lived in Donostia-San Sebastian, which is Basque country. We also explored a bit in Southern France Basque country, including a quite fascinating Witch's Museum.

Here's a pic of the bay. Jona and Emme stayed in an apartment on the opposite side of the hill you see at the left:

And an Irish singer because after Spain, we tooled around Ireland with Kathryn. Here's a pic of the church in Cork where my grandfather Lyons' great uncle was likely baptised, the oldest Catholic church in the city:

So enough travelogue. On with the music.

Enjoy!
